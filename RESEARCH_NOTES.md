- Temporal separation synergy: GSPO's sequence-level optimization complements HRM's high-level (slow) and low-level (fast) module separation
- Mathematical harmony: Both avoid problematic token-level importance weights that cause training instability

**Enhanced ACT Mechanism**:
```python
# GSPO-Enhanced HRM ACT
Q_values = Q_head(z_H^(NT))  # HRM's final H-state
importance_ratio = (π_θ(y|x) / π_θ_old(y|x))^(1/|y|)  # GSPO's sequence ratio
halt_decision = Q_learning_with_sequence_importance(Q_values, importance_ratio)
```

**Training Stability Benefits**:
