## Potential Future Issues (Risk Register)

### Architecture & Technical Risks

#### Issue #001: HRM Architecture Modification Complexity
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: Potentially Blocking  

**Description**: Modifying HRM's core architecture for code generation may be more complex than anticipated, potentially requiring significant changes to the hierarchical reasoning mechanism.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (could delay Phase 1 by 2-4 weeks)
- **Timeline Risk**: Architecture modifications are on critical path

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with minimal viable modifications
- Implement incremental changes with testing at each step
- Maintain fallback to original architecture if modifications fail
- Plan for 50% time buffer on architecture tasks

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Gradient flow issues during forward pass modifications
- ACT mechanism instability with new input formats
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds

#### Issue #002: Multi-Language Support Complexity
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Slowing  

**Description**: Supporting 6 programming languages efficiently while maintaining HRM's small parameter count may require complex trade-offs between shared and language-specific components.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Medium-High
- **Impact**: Medium (could affect performance targets)
- **Timeline Risk**: May delay Phase 2 dataset integration

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with 1-2 languages, expand gradually
- Design shared vocabulary and embedding strategy early
- Plan for language-specific fine-tuning if needed
- Consider hierarchical language grouping (C-family, etc.)

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Cross-language performance gaps >20%
- Memory usage scaling linearly with language count
- Training instability with multi-language batches

#### Issue #003: Quantization Performance Degradation
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Slowing  

**Description**: Aggressive quantization (4-bit) may cause unacceptable performance loss for code generation tasks, which are more sensitive to precision than natural language tasks.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (may not meet efficiency targets)
- **Timeline Risk**: Could delay Phase 3 optimization work

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Test quantization impact early with simple tasks
- Implement quantization-aware training from start
- Plan for mixed-precision approaches if needed
- Consider dynamic quantization based on task complexity

**Early Warning Signs**:
- >10% performance loss with 8-bit quantization
- Syntax errors or compilation failures increase significantly
- Code quality degradation beyond acceptable thresholds

### Dataset & Training Risks

#### Issue #004: Benchmark Data Quality Issues
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Slowing  

**Description**: LiveCodeBench or Polyglot benchmark data may have quality issues, formatting problems, or licensing restrictions that complicate usage.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Low-Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (could delay dataset development)
- **Timeline Risk**: May affect Phase 2 schedule

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Analyze benchmark data quality early in next sprint
- Have backup data sources identified
- Plan for data cleaning and validation pipelines
- Understand licensing constraints upfront

**Early Warning Signs**:
- High error rates in data extraction
- Inconsistent problem/solution formats
- Licensing restrictions on commercial use

#### Issue #005: Training Instability with New Architecture
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: Potentially Blocking  

**Description**: Modified HRM architecture may exhibit training instability, convergence issues, or gradient problems that prevent effective learning.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (could block all progress)
- **Timeline Risk**: Critical path dependency

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement careful gradient monitoring and clipping
- Use smaller learning rates initially
- Plan for extensive hyperparameter tuning
- Maintain baseline comparison throughout

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Loss function oscillation or divergence
- Gradient norm explosion or vanishing
- ACT mechanism failing to converge
- Performance plateau well below targets

### Resource & Infrastructure Risks

#### Issue #006: Computational Resource Constraints
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Slowing  

**Description**: Training modified HRM on larger code generation datasets may require more computational resources than originally planned.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Low-Medium (may slow development)
- **Timeline Risk**: Minimal if caught early

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Monitor training resource usage carefully
- Plan for cloud resource scaling if needed
- Implement efficient data loading and batching
- Consider curriculum learning to reduce training time

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Training time >2x original estimates
- Memory usage exceeding available GPU memory
- Need for distributed training earlier than planned

### External Dependencies

#### Issue #007: Benchmark Repository Changes
**Status**: Risk Identified  
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Minor  

**Description**: LiveCodeBench or Polyglot benchmark repositories may change, update, or become unavailable during development.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Low (manageable with local copies)
- **Timeline Risk**: Minimal

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Fork repositories immediately when starting work
- Maintain local copies of all benchmark data
- Document exact versions and commits used
- Have alternative benchmark sources identified

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Repository access failures
- Breaking changes in benchmark format
- Evaluation pipeline modifications
