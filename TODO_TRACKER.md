## Risk Tracking

### Current Risks
- **Architecture Complexity**: HRM modifications may be more complex than anticipated
  - *Mitigation*: Start with minimal viable changes, iterate incrementally
- **Multi-Language Challenges**: Supporting 6 languages efficiently
  - *Mitigation*: Begin with 1-2 languages, expand gradually
- **Performance Targets**: Ambitious efficiency goals may be unrealistic
  - *Mitigation*: Set progressive milestones, validate early and often

### Risk Monitoring
- Track architecture modification complexity in each implementation task
- Monitor multi-language performance gaps during development
- Measure efficiency metrics at each milestone
