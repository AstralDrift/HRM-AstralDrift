### Key Insights & Lessons Learned

#### Project Management Insights
- **"Rome wasn't built in a day" philosophy works**: Breaking massive tasks into atomic pieces (1-4 hours) makes progress tangible and manageable
- **Documentation-first approach pays off**: Comprehensive planning reduces later confusion and rework
- **Sprint structure provides clarity**: Clear time-boxed goals prevent scope creep and maintain focus

#### Technical Insights
- **HRM's hierarchical structure is ideal for code generation**: Natural mapping between strategic planning (high-level) and implementation details (low-level)
- **Efficiency targets are ambitious but achievable**: 27M parameters → <100M with quantization should enable local deployment
- **Multi-language support requires careful design**: Shared reasoning backbone with language-specific components

#### Research Findings
- **LiveCodeBench provides contamination-free evaluation**: Temporal filtering ensures fair assessment
- **Polyglot benchmark tests real coding skills**: Diff-based editing more challenging than simple generation
- **Quantization research is advancing rapidly**: 4-bit quantization becoming viable for code generation
