- Uses novel ACT (Adaptive Computation Time) wrapper for dynamic computation
- Training pipeline supports distributed training with W&B integration
- Model achieves SOTA results with minimal training data (1000 samples)

### Architecture Understanding
- Two-level hierarchy: High-level planning + Low-level execution
- Non-autoregressive design with adaptive halting via Q-learning
- Sparse puzzle embeddings for task-specific adaptation
- RMSNorm + SwiGLU with rotary/learned positional encodings

- **Task Breakdown**: `TASK_BREAKDOWN.md` with atomic, actionable tasks (1-4 hour chunks)
- **Documentation Structure**: Complete project management and knowledge tracking system
- **Development Philosophy**: "Rome wasn't built in a day" - systematic incremental building

### Research Insights
- **LiveCodeBench**: pass@1/pass@5 metrics, contamination-free evaluation, multi-scenario testing
- **Polyglot Benchmark**: 6 languages (C++, Go, Java, JS, Python, Rust), diff-based editing format
- **Code Generation Trends**: Quantization-aware training, CPU optimization, multi-language architectures
- **Hierarchical Code Reasoning**: Strategic planning vs implementation details, tool use integration
