# HRM-AstralDrift Changelog

## 2025-07-27

### Initial Setup
- **Project Familiarization**: Analyzed HRM codebase structure and capabilities
- **Documentation Created**: 
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Persistent memory file for Claude Code sessions
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - This file for tracking updates and learnings

### Key Learnings
- HRM is a hierarchical reasoning architecture with 27M parameters
- Supports ARC-AGI, Sudoku, and Maze reasoning tasks
- Uses novel ACT (Adaptive Computation Time) wrapper for dynamic computation
- Training pipeline supports distributed training with W&B integration
- Model achieves SOTA results with minimal training data (1000 samples)

### Architecture Understanding
- Two-level hierarchy: High-level planning + Low-level execution
- Non-autoregressive design with adaptive halting via Q-learning
- Sparse puzzle embeddings for task-specific adaptation
- RMSNorm + SwiGLU with rotary/learned positional encodings

### Agent Recommendations (Completed)
- **HRM Training Optimizer**: For managing training experiments and hyperparameter tuning
- **HRM Architecture Specialist**: For modifying and extending the HRM architecture  
- **Puzzle Dataset Manager**: For creating and augmenting puzzle datasets
- **Reasoning Evaluator**: For comprehensive model evaluation and analysis
- **ML Research Assistant**: For exploring related work and architectural improvements

### Major Project Pivot: Code Generation & Tool Use Focus
- **New Objective**: Transform HRM for world-class code generation and CLI tool use performance
- **Target Benchmarks**: LiveCodeBench (400+ coding challenges) and Polyglot (225 multi-language problems)
- **Efficiency Goals**: <100M parameters, <2GB memory, local deployment with quantization support
- **Key Innovation**: Adapt hierarchical reasoning for code planning (high-level) â†’ implementation (low-level)

### Comprehensive Planning Completed
- **Master Plan**: `HRM_CODE_GENERATION_PLAN.md` with 5-phase roadmap
- **Task Breakdown**: `TASK_BREAKDOWN.md` with atomic, actionable tasks (1-4 hour chunks)
- **Documentation Structure**: Complete project management and knowledge tracking system
- **Development Philosophy**: "Rome wasn't built in a day" - systematic incremental building

### Research Insights
- **LiveCodeBench**: pass@1/pass@5 metrics, contamination-free evaluation, multi-scenario testing
- **Polyglot Benchmark**: 6 languages (C++, Go, Java, JS, Python, Rust), diff-based editing format
- **Code Generation Trends**: Quantization-aware training, CPU optimization, multi-language architectures
- **Hierarchical Code Reasoning**: Strategic planning vs implementation details, tool use integration
